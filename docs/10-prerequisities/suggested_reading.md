# Mandatory readings for newcomers

Nowadays, doing research in this field is not just about the theory and occasional lab experiment.
When we prepare our experiments, we rely on a relatively complex platform of software and utilities, which allows us to implement new techniques and test them in realistic conditions.
But knowing the fundamentals is only half of the success.
The following list is prepared to mitigate the initial friction between you and the platform.
Please follow it thoroughly and enjoy the learning!

## Mandatory Software to learn

### ROS - Robot Operating System


### Catkin - the ROS compilation overlord


### GIT - code versioning system


### TMUX - terminal multiplexer

### Tmuxinator - automating tmux


### Vim - TUI-based text editor


### C++; the MRS language of choice
